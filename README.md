# 3.MultiTellerBankSimulation
Implementation of an embedded, stand-alone Athena QNX Neutrino program to simulate the workflow in a typical  banking environment. A single queue, which directs the customers independently to separate (multi-threaded) three separate bank teller threads. System currently implemented with three tellers but can be easily extended to additional tellers.
