Multi-Teller Bank Simulation
Implementation of an embedded, stand-alone Athena QNX Neutrino program
to simulate the workflow in a typical  banking environment. A single queue,
directs the customers independently to separate (multi-threaded) three separate
bank teller threads.

System currently implemented with three tellers but can be easily extended to additional tellers.
